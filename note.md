# Hands-On assignment

- Create a mini console based app using Dart that solves a real-life problem:
- Must use:

  - Variables
  - Data types
  - User inputs
  - Operators
  - Functions
  - Control flow (ifs and loops)
  - Exception handling

  Managing expenses can be hard sometimes but it's that one thing that if we can manage it our life would be somewhat better where we can track and be more careful on where we spend our money on. There are many apps that has help people on this but most of them are apps, GUI, what I present here is a CLI app where you can "note down" your expenses where those expenses will be saved locally. Even though the UI and UX is not that good but at least you can jot down all of your expenses.

  P.S.: To help get a better UI maybe you can use a better terminal emulator like Kitty (Linux and Mac) or Wezterm (Windows, Linux, and Mac), you can use Powershell (5 or 7) or Command Prompt though if you don't want to install another terminal emulator, and maybe install and use Nerd Fonts for your terminal and enable the ligature.
